<i><b>CSCIe56 – Final Project Proposal 
      
      Last Few Cards
      
      Sports cards (any collectible card set, really) come in sets of X cards.  Some collectors 
      like to piece together the sets from opening packs of cards (instead of just buying the 
      set outright -- which sometimes you can't do anyway).  But how does the collector keep 
      track of what cards are missing from each set they are building?  And how can he/she 
      match up with other collectors for the most efficient exchange of cards to complete 
      their respective sets?
      
       
      
      LastFewCards is a collectible card webapp that allows collectors to easily check off 
      which cards they have in each particular set they are building, then share the list 
      of missing cards with fellow collectors.  Users can also list the cards of which they 
      have extra copies - so that they have some trading power with other users in order to 
      obtain the cards they are missing.  
      
       
      
      Queries in the background match collectors based on how many cards the other collectors 
      have that a particular user needs - allowing for efficient exchange and faster set 
      building.
      
       
      
      Problems solved with this project:
      
      Creates an efficiency in the collectible cards market to allow users to complete set 
      building without procuring needed cards one at a time.
      
      Creates a GUI for collectors seeking the cards they need, while simultaneously 
      providing a marketplace for users to display the cards they are looking to offload.
      
      Users save on shipping costs for their hobby – bundling 10-20 cards into one package 
      instead of 1 card each in 20 packages; the point of the webapp is to efficiently map 
      user connections by card count needed.
